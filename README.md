# Social-Dilemma-Tweet-RNN

## Overview
The Social Dilemma Tweet RNN Project is an experimental project that utilizes Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to analyze and generate tweets related to social dilemmas. Inspired by the increasing impact of social media on public opinion and the ethical challenges it presents, this project aims to explore the potential of machine learning in understanding and simulating the discourse surrounding social dilemmas.

## Motivation
With the increasing influence of social media on public opinion and behavior, understanding the content and sentiment of tweets discussing social dilemmas is crucial. This project seeks to unravel the complexities of such discussions and provide insights into the way people express themselves in the online realm when faced with conflicting choices or ethical challenges.

## Features
 * Tweet Generation: Trained on a diverse dataset of social dilemma-related tweets, the RNN model is capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant tweets on social dilemmas.

* Sentiment Analysis: The project includes sentiment analysis to categorize generated and input tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, providing a deeper understanding of 
  the emotional tone surrounding social dilemmas.

* Customization: The model can be fine-tuned on specific datasets or adapted for other text generation tasks, making it versatile for various natural language processing applications.
